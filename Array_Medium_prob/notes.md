The code you provided has a small logical mistake in the condition within the second loop. The issue lies in the condition if (row[i] || col[j] == 1).

Issue:
In C++, the == operator has a higher precedence than the || (logical OR) operator. This means that col[j] == 1 will be evaluated first, and then the result (true/false) will be logically OR-ed with row[i]. This is not what you intend.

You intend to check whether either row[i] == 1 or col[j] == 1. However, the current code checks:

cpp
Copy code
if (row[i] || (col[j] == 1))
which means it first evaluates col[j] == 1 and then applies the || operator.

Correct Condition:
To ensure that both row[i] and col[j] are properly compared, you should use parentheses or ensure both comparisons are explicit:

cpp
Copy code
if (row[i] == 1 || col[j] == 1)
