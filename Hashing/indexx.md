Hashing in data structures is a technique that converts a key or string of characters into a shorter value, which makes it easier to find and use the original string. It's a common method for implementing hash tables, which store key and value pairs in a list that can be accessed by index. Hashing is used for a variety of purposes, including: 
Data indexing and retrieval: Hashing is used to quickly identify a specific value in an array. 
Digital signatures: Hash data is created and encrypted when a digital signature is created and encrypted with a private key. 
Cybersecurity and cryptography: Hashing is relevant to these areas. 
Uniquely identifying objects: Hashing can be used to assign a unique number to a book in a library or a student in a university
